                <h2>UX Case Study // Fall 2017</h2>
                <p>For a senior UX design class, I selected, researched, and designed a digital solution and pitch for the crafting
                    supply chain Michaels. To address a competitive market where Michaels is falling behind in digital sales,
                    my team and I designed a crafting studio that draws customers both in-store and online.

                <h2>Design Overview</h2>
                <p>Michaels Crafting Studio is an experience that lives on a new section the Michaels website. It stores and
                    suggests crafts to visitors, be they a wary beginner or a veteran crafter. Each craft is packaged in
                    a kit with all necessary materials and can be picked up in-store off the shelf or pre-ordered online.
                    The crafter can then book a space at the in-store studio to borrow tools, or take it straight home.
                </p>

                />
                <h2>Framing the Problem</h2>
                <p>The crafting industry is worth $44 billion, and Michaels is one of the leading craft suppliers in the industry.
                    However, in 2017 there was a major shift in the target audience due to the popularity of Pinterest and
                    Youtube tutorials. These new crafters’ journeys primarily begin in a digital space,
                    <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/debraborchardt/2017/02/15/watch-out-michaels-because-etsy-is-entering-the-44-billion-craft-supplies-marketplace/">but digital competitors like Amazon and Etsy are better equipped to serve them.</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Rather than try and catch up to Etsy in a digital space or attempt to replace Michaels successful in-store experience, I
                    asked my team how might we encourage inexperienced crafters to migrate from online to in-store where
                    Michaels can best support them to start and continue their crafting journey?
                </p>

        </section>

        <section class="body-container">

                <img class="container-photo" src="img/michaels/initialDesign.png" alt="A picture of Andrew smiling at the counter of the shop serving a long line of customers"
                />
                <h2>First Prototype</h2>
                <p>Our first prototype had crafters entering Michaels through a Pinterest widget, meeting them where they were.
                    Pinterest and Michaels had collaborated in the past, so we knew this was a feasible entry. However, when
                    our users entered the widget and found themselves going through a purchase process for the kit, they
                    found it dishonest and it felt more like an ad than a helpful feature.
                </p>
                <p>We also had too many screens in the purchase and booking process, the screens shown above are 3 of 8, causing
                    frustration for our user-testers.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="body-container">

                />
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="body-container">
            <div>
                <h2>Revised Prototype</h2>
                <p>We greatly reduced the amount of screens to ease the entry to the experience (reduced from 8 to 3). However,
                    a widget still felt too dishonest and unclear for users, so we dropped this entry feature in favour of
                    focusing on the engagement stage of the experience. Entry is hugely important, but a lack continuous
                    engagement was a key friction for our target demographic and needed our full attention.
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="body-container">

                />
                <h2>Creating a Cyclical Journey</h2>
                <p>I was in charge of the overall flow of the experience. After analyzing the journey framework we created and
                    identifying key frictions as a group, it became clear that the existing journey was too linear. People
                    stopped in at Michaels for specialty items or quick advise only 2-3 times a year. One even admitted
                    <em>"I wouldn’t say I’ve ever actually completed [any crafts]. I’ll say I hate this and I’ll give up."</em>
                </p>

                <p>Our long term goal became: How might we encourage crafters to continue making, and make Michaels the go-to
                    resource? So we intervened in existing spaces to set crafters up to succeed and be satisfied with their
                    end results so they were less likely to give up on crafting</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="body-container">
            <div>
                <img class="container-photo" src="img/michaels/full.png" alt="A picture of Andrew smiling at the counter of the shop serving a long line of customers"
                />
                <h2>Creating Moments of Delight</h2>
                <p>Although our proposed design addressed all of our major frictions and met our long term goal, it was missing
                    moments of delight.
                    <em>The digital side of the experience lacked Michaels friendly, anticipatory support that crafters get in
                        store.</em>
                </p>
                <p>I debated with my team on how to accomplish this for days. Ironically, a very small intervention was our
                    missing piece. We included a small, free gift for our users upon completion of a craft as a reward. Upon
                    completing a craft, the user would receive an email that guides them back to the Crafting Studio tab
                    of the website to claim their prize. Once back here, they can explore new crafts, or simply complete
                    the mini-craft we gifted to them. Either way, we are succeeding in encouraging them to continue on their
                    crafting journey.</p>

                <p>The solution is hard to explain with words or diagrams alone as the solutions moves between digital and physical
                    space. The video below should get the job done though:

        <section class="body-container">
            <h2>Value Proposition</h2>
            <p>Our intervention focused on the intangible values that in turn affected the others. This, in totality, encourages
                them to visit Michaels more and makes it easy to go back and see all their personalized suggestions and recommendations:
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Tangible</em> goals of making a great craft by guiding from start-to-finish and addressed by teaching them
                the skill set they need to succeed.</p>
            <p>
                <em>Intangible</em> goals of completing a craft and being satisfied with the result addressed with In-store experts
                and equipment, pre-made kits, and meeting them where they are</p>
            <p>
                <em>Aspirational</em> goals of becoming a highly skilled crafter who is able to proudly display and share their
                projects by visualizing their Crafting Journey.
            </p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>I am satified with our final solution. While not a complete experience, it is a strong proposal to build upon,
                and I have considered bringing to Michaels executives with my team. </p>

            <p>
                <em>Design-wise</em>, we made sure all of our key interactions decisions reinforced at least one of the brand
                analysis discipline.
                <em>For technological feasibility</em>, rather than require our customers to download an app, they can just access
                the website. This was informed by our user testers, some of which were uninterested in downloading non essential
                apps on their phone.
                <em>Content was also largely considered</em>, as the visuals and supportive tone directly matched Michaels content
                strategy based on what we observed of their existing products and services
