                <h1>Vice Perspectives Chatbot Overview</h1>
                <h2>US Case Study // Fall 2017</h2>
                <p>For a senior UX design class, I selected, researched, and designed a digital solution and pitch for VICE
                    News. To address a market oversaturated with video content, my team and I designed a chatbot that delivers
                    first-hand, journalistic news through a personable, chatbot interface.

                <h2>Design Overview</h2>
                <p>Vice is projected to miss their target revenue as of late 2017, and it’s not just them. Their industry is
                    oversaturated — everyone shifted into long form video content at the same time. How might we leverage
                    what’s always made them different: under reported news and gritty frontline perspectives told by relatable
                    reporters that tell you stories like a friend would, not a corporation?
                </p>

                />

                <h2>Framing the Problem</h2>
                <p>Vox, Buzzfeed, Vice... all of these digital media groups have moved to video content platforms rather than
                    written articles. Problem is, since everyone shifted to video, the market has become oversaturated and
                    Vice is projected to miss their target revenue as of late 2017 as illustrated above.</p>

                <p>Using the success of their reporting on Charlottesville as a key example, we asked how might we leverage
                    what’s always made them different: under reported news and gritty frontline perspectives told by relatable
                    reporters that tell you stories like a friend would, not a corporation?
                </p>

                <img class="container-photo" src="img/vice/Tone.png" alt="A picture of Andrew smiling at the counter of the shop serving a long line of customers"
                />
                <h2>Brand and Tone</h2>
                <p>My brand analysis of Vice News surfaced 4 themes for our team: Raw, Hard-hitting, Deferential, and Intimate.
                    Vice is unique in that people tend to see the brand as a person, they think their audience is smarter
                    than them and cultivates the image of a knowledgeable friend that tells you like it is. We analyzed the
                    <a href="https://www.rga.com/work/case-studies/ask-for-a-raise">Cindy Gallop chatbot (a screenshot of this chatbot can be seen above)</a> for ideas on tone and feasibility.</p>
                <h2>User Frictions with News articles</h2>
                <p>Based on a 5 day SPRINT, our users also noted that
                    <em>"articles can be kind of bland - photos, text, done".</em>
                    In summary, news is often dry and hard to digest and they often can't be bothered to seek it out; they prefer having a conversation
                    about news than just reading dry facts.
                </p>

                <img class="container-photo" src="img/vice/initialDesign-.png" alt="A picture of Andrew smiling at the counter of the shop serving a long line of customers"
                />
                <h2>First Prototype</h2>
                <p>Our first prototype was clunky, but it surfaced a major question from our users:
                    <em>"Why a chatbot? Why not just let me talk to the journalist?".</em> It was a valid issue, chatbots are
                    trendy; a buzzword. When people think of a chatbot, they usually think of a personal assistant or a support
                    desk. They also raised issues about onboarding, it wasn't clear that they were talking to a bot, they
                    thought someone was speaking in real-time with them and felt betrayed when it wasn't a real person.
                </p>

                <p>There were also ethical issues surrounding showing explicit content to users when they were unprepared that
                    absolutely needed to be corrected.</p>

                />

                <h2>Revised Prototype</h2>
                <p>
                    <em>Instead of returning to the drawing board, we stuck to our guns.</em> Our goal was to create a conversation
                    and tell an engaging story with a defined personality without putting strain on Vice News staff and resources.
                    This conversational way of delivering information is what our persona wants, what Vice is good at, and
                    it’s why we chose this solution.
                </p>
                <p>However, we still needed to address the issues and objections brought up during testing, so I spent days
                    refining copy, ensuring the user was properly onboarded into the process, and also ensuring users had
                    options for the explicit content shown in the experience, which can be seen above.
                </p>

            <h2>Value Proposition</h2>
            <p>Our intervention adds value to Vice in 3 ways:
                <em>data collection from user choices</em> that can be used to refine the experience,
                <em>bring in outside viewership </em>as current users share their thoughts on social media and this potentially
                engages friends who aren’t Vice followers, and
                <em>further differentiate</em> in an oversaturated market by remixing their raw, first-hand coverage and journalist
                personalities.
            </p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>I am satisfied with this experience, but I have some caveats to add. People who prefer traditional, non-partisan
                news simply will not engage with this media, and readers that have different beliefs or perspectives from
                the journalists may feel antagonized or excluded.</p>
            <p>I also know that "fake" news and journalism in general are topics greatly debated at the moment in the US, but
                I do believe that this intervention fits the persona that Vice portrays themselves as; it's controversial,
                sparks conversation, and assumes that audiences are smart enough to know the difference between fact and
                opinion.
                <em>As such, I have some reservations about our solution as is.</em> I think it's a great starting point, but
                it needs careful testing and ethical thought put into it before it could ever launch.
